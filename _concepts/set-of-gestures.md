Several attemps have been made to describe the gestural input through which users interact with the interface of an elastic display. In [User-Defined Gestures for Elastic, Deformable Displays](({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) Troiano et al. report a guessability study to describe the gesture set users prefer to perform on elastic, deformable displays. An investigation of tabletop gestures can be found in [Investigating Gestures on Elastic Tabletops](({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) by Kammer et al. In [Gestures in Human-Computer-Interaction](({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) Muser gives a general overwiew of different approaches for gesture classification that can be used to formalize the findings in other research papers towards a more complete and structured gesture classification.
