title: Set of Gestures for Elastic Displays
description: set of gestures in interactive visualizations
---
*"A gesture is a motion of the body that contains information. Waving goodbye is a gesture. Pressing a key on a keyboard is not a gesture because the motion of a finger on its way to hitting a key is neither observed nor significant. All that matters is which key was pressed".* [Kurtenbach and Hulteen]

Gestures are the input through which users interact with the interface of an display. But where exactly does it start and where does it end? Is it just a movement or maybe more? Numerous approaches in numerous disciplines exist to describe what a gesture is. According to the cite above a gesture is a movement of the body that is performed to convey meaning. Meaning therefore implicitly creates the boundaries of a single gesture, which consists of everything that must necessarily be performed to encode the meaning in a specific communication space.

### Gestures in the context of Elastic Displays
 The communication space of elastic displays includes users performing movements with their hands and a display that observes the deformation of its surface, mostly from beyond. Following the approach of user-centered design, our set of gestures describes the gestures performable on elastic display from the user's point of view. The user's intention to "tell" the display something meaningful creates the boundaries that define the start and end of a single gesture. (Note: Under [tracking technologies]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/tracking-technologies) you can find more on technical gesture recognition, derived from the user-defined gesture set.)

### Classifying Gestures
What types of gestures exist and which of them are relevant in the context of elastic displays? In [Gestures in Human-Computer-Interaction]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) Muser gives a general overwiew of different approaches for gesture classification. She presents Cadoz' functional classification of hand gestures:

- **Ergotic** : the action of modifying the environment, e.g. [direct manipulation]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/direct-manipulation), shaping pottery
- **Epistemic** : the action of getting knowledge from the environment, e.g. exploring material via the tactile sense
- **Semiotic** : the action of conveying information to the environment, e.g. waving good-bye or communicating by sign language 

Semiotic gestures (the ones that have been used as input modality in HCI mostly) include:

- **Deictic**: pointing, e.g. using a mouse pointer
- **Motor**: marking the rhythm of speech 
- **Symbolic / emblematic**: following contextual convertions, e.g. thumbs up
- **Iconic**: representing the content of the speech, e.g. by drawing a shape
- **Metaphoric**: showing abstract ideas
 
 Compared to traditional HCI, elastic displays enlarge especially the space of ergotic and epistemic gestures as they let the user perform gestures in depth and provide rich haptic feedback. Among the semiotic gestures the deictic, symbolic / emblematic an iconic gestures are the relevant ones for elastic displays as they must not be performed mid-air but include touching and shaping the display's surface. 

### Set of Gestures for Elastic Displays
Several attemps have been made to collect, categorize and describe the gestural input modalities for elastic displays specifically. In [User-Defined Gestures for Elastic, Deformable Displays]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) Troiano et al. report a guessability study to describe the gesture set users prefer to perform on elastic, deformable displays. They identify 29 single or both-handed gestures and explain what tasks they are suitable for. An investigation of tabletop gestures can be found in [Investigating Gestures on Elastic Tabletops]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) by Kammer et al. The video [Obake: interactions with a 2.5D elastic display]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#links) contains a collection of gestural interactions on elastic 2.5D displays.
