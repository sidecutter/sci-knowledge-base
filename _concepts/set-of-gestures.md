## What is a gesture?
Gestures as the input through which users interact with the interface of an elastic display. But where exactly does a gesture start and where does it end? Is it just a movement or does it have an implicit meaning? 

Kurtenbach and Hulteen: “A gesture is a motion of the body that contains information. Waving goodbye is a gesture. Pressing a key on a keyboard is not a gesture because the motion of a finger on its way to hitting a key is neither observed nor significant. All that matters is which key was pressed”. 

Meaning can only be conveyed successfully if the sender knows how to perform the gesture (encoding) and the receiver is able to understand it (decoding). Sender and receiver have to share a communication space therefore. In the scope of elastic displays this sphere includes a user performing movements with his or her hands and a display observing deformation of a surface, mostly from beyond. The Set of Gestures gives an overview on gestures performable on elastic display. The user's intention to "tell" the display something meaningful and the display's capability to sense the gestural input are the boundaries that define the start and end of a single gesture.

## Research
Several attemps have been made to collect, categorize and describe the gestural input modalities on elastic displays. In [User-Defined Gestures for Elastic, Deformable Displays]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) Troiano et al. report a guessability study to describe the gesture set users prefer to perform on elastic, deformable displays. An investigation of tabletop gestures can be found in [Investigating Gestures on Elastic Tabletops]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) by Kammer et al. In [Gestures in Human-Computer-Interaction]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#references) Muser gives a general overwiew of different approaches for gesture classification that can be used to formalize the findings in other research papers towards a more complete and structured gesture classification. The video [Obake: interactions with a 2.5D elastic display](/resources/#links) contains a collection of gestural interactions on elastic 2.5D displays.
