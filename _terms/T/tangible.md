A Tangible is a thing that is perceptible by touch, making data and the impact of interaction on data literally graspable. In [tangible user interfaces](/terms/tangible-user-interface) they can be used to control the input and represent the output of an interaction, e.g. a volume control that informs the user about the adjusted volume through its state.
