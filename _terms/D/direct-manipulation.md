Direct manipulation is an interaction style first coined by Ben Shneiderman in the early 1980s, when humans usually interacted with computers via the command line. In direct manipulation the objects of interest in the UI are continuosly visible, they can be acted upon physically and allow reversible, incremental actions while providing continuous feedback.
