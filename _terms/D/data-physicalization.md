description: Data Physicalization in ZELASTO Knowledge Base

Data Physicalizations, also known as Physical Visualization, are the physical counterpart of purely visual data visualizations. Three-dimensional, often shapeable physical representations of data provide physical metaphors that allow to explore, reason and communicate about the semantic of data.
The research area of Data Physicalization involves novel types of interfaces such as [actuated dislays](/terms/actuated-display) or [tangible](/terms/tangible-user-interface) and [shape-changing interfaces](/terms/shape-changing-interface).
