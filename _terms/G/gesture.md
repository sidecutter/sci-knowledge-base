description: definition of gesture in SCI Knowledge Base
---
A gesture can be defined as a movement of the body that is acted out to convey meaning with regard to the communication space in which it is performed. Meaning therefore implicitly creates the boundaries of a single gesture, which consists of everything that must necessarily be performed to encode the meaning. See more under [Set of Gestures for Elastic Displays]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/set-of-gestures).
